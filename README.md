# Job Search Question Code Examples
While doing interviews or applying for jobs, I have been getting coding questions.  This repro is a project with a set of classes that actually does what the question from the test or interview was wanting me to write.  There are also tests for the routines that I used to help make sure the routine was working as expected.

I have done the same coding in C#, VB.NET, F# and Managed C++.  I have all of the questions answered in the same way in each language, but I did the unit tests for the C++ ones in C# because I was having issues figuring out how to write the tests in C++.  I am thinking about implementing the same answers in native C++, but I have not gone there yet.

## Questions

1. Give me a routine that can compare version numbers and returns: -1 if the first is less than the second; 0 if they are equal; and 1 if the first is greater than the second.
1. Take a linked list and reverse the entries in the list
1. Take an array of employee start year and end year values and return the maximum number of people who worked together.
1. How do you find the missing number in an array of 1-100?
