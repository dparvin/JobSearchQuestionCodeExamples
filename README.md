# Job Search Question Code Examples
While doing interviews or applying for jobs, I have been getting coding questions.  This repro is a project with a set of classes that actually does what the question from the test or interview was wanting me to write.  There are also tests for the routines that I used to help make sure the routine was working as expected.

## Questions

1. Give me a routine that can compare version numbers and returns: -1 if the first is less than the second; 0 if they are equal; and 1 if the first is greater than the second.
1. Take a linked list and reverse the entries in the list
1. take an array of employee start year and end year values and return the maximum number of people who worked together.
